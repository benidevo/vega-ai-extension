**Save job listings to your personal dashboard with one click.**

This Chrome extension adds a floating button to LinkedIn job pages that lets you save jobs directly to your Vega AI dashboard. All actions are initiated by you. The extension never collects or saves data automatically. Works with both the cloud service and self-hosted [Vega AI](https://vega.benidevo.com) backends.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Shows on** job pages on LinkedIn when you visit them
- 💾 **User-initiated save** with the floating button
- 📝 **Add notes** before saving (saved locally too)
- 🔐 **Secure authentication**: username/password with encrypted storage
- 🌐 **Cloud or self-hosted**: your choice
- ⚡ **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+Shift+V to toggle, Ctrl+S to save
- 🔔 **Version updates**: Automatic update notifications
- 🔄 **Syncs across devices** when signed in

## 🎬 How it Works

1. Go to any LinkedIn job posting
2. Click the floating Vega AI button
3. Add your notes (optional)
4. Hit save and you're done

No more copy-pasting job details.

<summary>Click to expand developer setup instructions</summary>

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ and npm
- Chrome browser

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/benidevo/vega-ai-extension.git
cd vega-ai-extension
npm install

# Build and load
npm run build
```

Then load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Watch mode for development
npm run build      # Production build
npm run test       # Run tests
npm run lint       # Check code style
npm run typecheck  # Check TypeScript types
```

### Configuration

By default, the extension uses username/password auth and connects to the cloud backend. You can change these defaults:

**Backend Modes:**

- Cloud Mode: `https://vega.benidevo.com` (default)
- Local Mode: Your own backend (set host/port in settings)

**Authentication:**

- Username/Password authentication with secure token storage
- Encrypted local storage for credentials
- Automatic session management

### Project Structure

The code is organized into these main parts:

- **Background**: Service worker that handles auth, API calls, and messaging
- **Content**: Scripts that run on LinkedIn pages to detect jobs
- **Popup**: The extension popup where users sign in and change settings
- **Services**: Reusable modules for common functionality

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Your privacy is priority:**

- ✅ **User-initiated only**: The extension never reads or saves data automatically
- ✅ **You control your data**: Only saves jobs when you explicitly click the save button
- ✅ **No tracking**: No analytics, no data collection beyond what you choose to save
- ✅ **Encrypted storage**: Your authentication tokens are encrypted locally
- ✅ **Open source**: Review the code to see exactly what the extension does
- ✅ **Minimal permissions**: Only accesses LinkedIn job pages, nothing else
