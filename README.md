### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Chrome browser

### Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/benidevo/vega-ai-extension.git
cd vega-ai-extension
npm install

# Build and load
npm run build
```

Then load the `dist` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

### Configuration

The extension uses **username/password authentication by default**. Google OAuth is available but disabled by default.

**Basic Setup** - Update API endpoint in `src/config/index.ts` if needed:

```typescript
api: {
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8765'  // Default port, change if your backend uses different port
}
```

**Optional: Enable Google OAuth** - Uncomment in production config:

```typescript
features: {
  enableGoogleAuth: true, // Uncomment and set to true
},
auth: {
  providers: {
    google: {
      clientId: 'your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com' // Add your client ID
    }
  }
}
```
